### Windows
The Python installers for Windows include pip. 
You should be able to access pip using:

`$py -m pip --version`


`$py -m pip install --upgrade pip`
**Install packages:**
`$pip install numpy`

**Run code:**
`python main.py`

### Linux and macOS
Debian and most other distributions include a python-pip package, if you want to use the Linux distribution-provided versions of pip see Installing pip/setuptools/wheel with Linux Package Managers.

You can also install pip yourself to ensure you have the latest version. Itâ€™s recommended to use the system pip to bootstrap a user installation of pip:

`python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip`
Afterwards, you should have the newest pip installed in your user site:

`$python3 -m pip --version`
**Install packages:**
`$pip install numpy`
